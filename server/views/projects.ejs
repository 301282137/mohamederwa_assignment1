            Mobile Application
          </h5>
          <p>
            Singlehandedly worked on creating a mobile application with a
            functional backend that supports user accounts and account
            management. Project developed in Dart and Flutter.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was an app where users can sign in using their email and password
            or use their social media accounts like Google, Facebook, and
            Twitter to log in. The app gave users a chance to win various
            amounts of money with a click of a button.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was responsible for designing, developing, and implementing this project.
            Application will be released on iPhone App Store and Google Play soon.
